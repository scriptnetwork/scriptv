RELAY DAEMON


bool c::process_work(socket::peer_t *c, datagram*d) 

input: datagram coming from peer
output: processed (true); not processed (false)

Brief:
Captures evidence datagrams.
If lower layers processed it done.
If the datagram is a harvester handle it.

As as soon as we know the datagram is an evidence we handle it here.

If the evidence progresses satisfactorily [-> process_evidence() pure virtual] is declared valid and propagated.

Specializations must provide implementation on how to process evidences.
