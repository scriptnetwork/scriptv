##str1## - node setup
Instructions (Windows oeprating systems)

1. (optional,advanced) Make sure you have UPnP function enabled in your broadband router.
    The node will try to program the router to forward ports 16671,16672,16673,15580 to itsels, so other nodes
    can initate connections with your node. If this process fails your node will still be working fine, but
    without helping inter-node connectivity (other nodes will try to reah you without success) which reduces
    global performance. 
    If you skip this step there is a chance the node will success opening ports, but if you feel skilled it is
    worth to access the router configuration and make sure UPnP function is enabled. Alternatively to UPnP you
    can program manually port forwarding. Range of TCP ports 16670-16680 should map to same range in the node.
    Program DHCP to assign the same IP address to the node's MAC address, to make sure port forwarding manual
    configuration lasts.
    Your router can tipically be accessed via the following URLs accessible via your internet browser:
        http://192.168.0.1 or http://192.168.1.1 
    But it could be any other, depending on your local LAN configuration, if none of these works:
    open a DOS shell.
    Start menu, select 'execute', type 'cmd'
    In the shell window type: ipconfig /all
    C:> ipconfig /all

    The use the ip address in your internet browser to access your router.
    Example: http://192.168.0.1
    Search in advanced configuration for UPnP and make sure it is enabled.
    Make also sure the firewall, if enabled, doesn't filter packets in the port range 16670-16680.

    Program DHCP to assign the same IP address to the node's MAC address, to make sure port forwarding manual
    configuration lasts.

2.- Download and unzip the US Operating System for the Raspberry Pi. 
	  The file is:
      ##str15##/raspberry_pi/##str_os_raspi##
      Check the size of the file after downloading it. It should be exactly ##str_os_raspi_size## bytes.
    2.1  Uncompress & record the US Operating System into the microSD card.
		1-unzip the downloaded file. The resulting image has extension .img
		2-use etcher to record the microSD using the uncompressed file. https://www.balena.io/etcher/

3. Insert the recorded microSD card in the raspberry pi slot.
	Tested models: Raspberry PI 3B+ with at least 16Gb microSD
    3.1. Connect the raspberry pi to your broadband router using a (short) ethernet cable.
    3.2. Connect a TV using a HDMI cable.
    3.3. Connect a USB keyboard.
    3.4. Power up the raspberry pi using an official power supply.
    3.5. Wait approximately 15 minutes until the instalation finishes
    3.6. Login with the user and password shown in screen. You’ll be forced to change the password. 
          Recommended procedure:
       3.6.1. Write down on paper a long sequence (~10) of random numbers and letters.
       3.6.1. Enter the new password twice.
       3.6.3. Store the paper in a safe place.
    3.7. Write down your IP address for later ssh access.
      Know the LAN IP address of your node. Example:
      $> hostname -I
      192.168.0.26 ...
    3.8. Type “us-help” to know more about the programs wallet and gov.
    3.9. Type exit to terminate the session.
    3.10. Unplug the HDMI cable and the keyboard
    3.11. Leave the node running 24/7 beside the broadband router.
4. Access your node via ssh,
    Use the program putty. https://putty.org/
    Parameters: 
     The LAN IP address obtained in section 3.7
     Port: 16671
     username: gov
5. (optional) Check installation.
    Go to to the following URL using a computer or the mobile using the WIFI of the router.
    http://adsl4ever.com/ip
    annotate your public IP address 
    send your public IP address by email to other.arkitech@protonmail.com 
    you'll receive a response with an assessment of a successful installation, or any issue detected.
